General Questions

What is mySafePlay™ and how does it work?
mySafePlay™ is a comprehensive biometric child safety platform that uses advanced AI with facial recognition technology to protect children in play venues. Our system provides real-time location tracking, instant safety alerts, emotion detection, and automatic photo capture. Features include QR code check-in/out, permission-based photo sharing between families, parent-to-parent communication, AI friendship detection, and enhanced navigation to help you find your child. We ensure complete privacy and security while creating a connected community of families.


How safe is my child's biometric data?
Data security is our top priority. All biometric data is encrypted using military-grade encryption and stored in secure, COPPA-compliant data centers. We never share personal data with third parties, and parents have full control over their data with the ability to delete it at any time. Our system is regularly audited by independent security firms.


What age range does mySafePlay™ support?
mySafePlay™ is designed for children aged 2-18 years. Our facial recognition and body language technology is optimized to work accurately with children's faces as they grow and change. The system learns and adapts to recognize children even as they age, ensuring consistent protection throughout their childhood.


How do I check my child in and out of venues?
mySafePlay™ uses a simple QR code and NFC Digital membership card for check-in and check-out. Each family receives a unique QR code and Digital Wallet Card that can be scanned at the venue entrance. The system automatically recognizes both you and your child through facial recognition and confirms your identities. You can also use the mobile app to check in multiple children at once and receive instant confirmation when they're safely in the venue.

What if I don't want to have my facial features scanned?

We also working on offering other options for detection such as a bracelet with a Bluetooth fab that can be tracked, much like GPS.

Is the Bluetooth fab as accurate as biometrics?

No, but it is an alternative if you are concerned about biometrics. Facial and body language recognition can also detect urgent and emergent situations such as injury, bullying, crying episodes and sadness. When these situations occur the system will immediately notify you and the venue staff to evaluate the situation. The fab also can't detect if your child is having a great time or interactions with other kids to capture special moments and create a montage.


What types of real-time alerts will I receive?
mySafePlay™ sends instant notifications for various safety and activity events: check-in/out confirmations, restricted area alerts, emotion detection triggers (if your child appears distressed), emergency situations, friendship activities, photo sharing opportunities, and location updates when your child moves between zones. You can customize which alerts you receive and how you want to be notified (push notification, text, and email).

AI Safety Features

How does mySafePlay™'s AI protect my child?
mySafePlay™'s AI continuously monitors for safety concerns using advanced computer vision and behavioral analysis. Our system detects emotional distress, bullying situations, overcrowding, and unauthorized access to restricted areas. When potential risks are identified, parents and venue staff receive instant alerts. The AI also ensures age-appropriate access to different areas and activities within the venue.


What is emotion detection and how does it work?
Our emotion detection technology analyzes facial expressions and body language to identify signs of distress, fear, or discomfort in children. This helps venue staff quickly respond to situations where a child might need help or attention. The system respects privacy by processing this information locally and only alerting when intervention may be needed for the child's wellbeing.


What behavioral patterns does mySafePlay™ monitor?
mySafePlay™ monitors patterns that could indicate safety concerns, such as aggressive behavior, social isolation, or situations that might escalate into conflicts. The system also tracks positive interactions and friendships, helping parents understand their child's social development. All monitoring is designed to enhance safety while respecting children's natural play and social interactions.


How does age estimation help with safety?
mySafePlay™'s age estimation ensures children access age-appropriate areas and activities. For example, toddler areas are protected from older children who might accidentally cause harm, while teen areas remain accessible only to appropriate age groups. This creates safer play environments tailored to different developmental stages and physical capabilities.

Photo & Video Sharing

How does photo sharing work with other families?
mySafePlay™'s smart photo sharing system automatically identifies when your child appears in photos with other children and offers to share those moments with the other families involved. All sharing requires explicit permission from both families, and you maintain complete control over which photos of your child can be shared. 

What is the connection bonus system?
When children play together frequently, their families can unlock enhanced features like automatic photo sharing, priority playtime notifications, and coordinated activity suggestions. This system encourages positive social connections while giving parents more ways to capture and share their children's friendships and memories.

How do I control who can see photos of my child?
You have complete control over photo permissions through your mySafePlay™ account. You can set preferences for automatic sharing with specific families, approve or deny individual photo sharing requests, and block sharing with any family. All photos remain private by default, and sharing only occurs with your explicit consent for each family or individual photo.

Can I get copies of photos my child appears in?
Yes! With your permission, when other families save photos that include your child, you can request copies through the mySafePlay™ app. The system automatically identifies your child in photos and notifies you when new photos are available. Other families can approve or share these photos with you, creating a collaborative approach to capturing memories.

Communication & Navigation

How can I connect with other parents?
mySafePlay™ includes secure parent-to-parent messaging features that let you connect with other families whose children play with yours. You can coordinate playdates, share parenting tips, organize group activities, and build community connections. All communication is moderated for safety and privacy, and you control who can contact you.


How does friendship detection work?
mySafePlay™'s AI analyzes play patterns, proximity, and positive interactions to identify developing friendships between children. When children consistently play together and show positive social behaviors, the system suggests friendship connections to parents. This helps you understand your child's social circle and can facilitate deeper friendships through coordinated activities.


Can I coordinate playdates through mySafePlay™?
Yes! mySafePlay™ includes playdate coordination tools that let you schedule activities with other families, share venue preferences, and coordinate timing. You can see when your child's friends are at the same venue and receive suggestions for group activities. The system also helps you find families with similar schedules and interests.

How do I find my child in the venue?
mySafePlay™'s enhanced navigation system provides real-time location tracking and optimal pathfinding to help you locate your child quickly. The mobile app shows your child's current location, and you can monitor visually what they are doing. In large venues, such as water parks, the mySafePlay™ app suggests the best route to reach them, and considers crowd density to avoid congested areas. You'll also receive notifications when your child moves to different zones within the venue.


Zone Management & Location

What are restricted zones and how do they work?
Restricted zones are areas within venues that are designated as off-limits for safety reasons - such as storage areas, kitchens, or maintenance zones. mySafePlay™ automatically detects when children enter these areas and immediately alerts both parents and venue staff. The system helps guide children back to safe play areas and prevents accidents before they happen.

How does capacity monitoring keep children safe?
mySafePlay™ continuously monitors the number of children in each area to prevent overcrowding, which can lead to accidents or discomfort. When areas approach capacity limits, the system alerts venue staff and suggests alternative play areas. This ensures optimal play experiences and maintains safe crowd densities throughout the venue.

What happens during an emergency evacuation?
During emergencies, mySafePlay™'s system immediately activates evacuation protocols, providing real-time guidance for the safest exit routes while avoiding congested areas. Parents receive instant notifications with their child's location and evacuation status. The system helps venue staff account for all children and ensures families are reunited safely at designated meeting points.

How accurate is the location tracking?
mySafePlay™'s location tracking is accurate to within 3-5 feet using a combination of facial recognition, camera networks, and zone-based monitoring. The system updates location information in real-time as children move throughout the venue, providing parents with current and precise information about their child's whereabouts and activities.

Check-in & Access

How does the QR code check-in system work?
Each family receives a unique QR code and NFC Digital membership card that serves as their digital key to mySafePlay™ venues. Simply scan your QR code or mobile digital card at the entrance, and the system automatically recognizes your children through facial recognition. The process takes seconds and provides instant confirmation that your children are safely checked in. The system also handles membership verification and payment processing automatically.

Can I check in multiple children at once?
Yes! One QR code or digital card scan can check in your entire family. The facial recognition system automatically identifies all your registered children as they enter, sending you individual confirmations for each child. You can also add temporary guests or playdates to your group through the mobile app before arriving at the venue.

What if I lose my QR code?
No problem! You can access your QR code or digital card anytime through the mySafePlay™ mobile app, email, or by providing identification at the venue. Venue staff can also verify your identity through the system and provide temporary access. For added security, QR codes and digital cards can be regenerated instantly if needed, and the old codes are automatically deactivated.


How do I check my child out?
Checking out is as simple as checking in - just scan your QR code or digital card at the exit. The system automatically confirms your children's identities and processes their departure. You'll receive a summary of their visit including photos, activities, and any notable moments. The checkout process ensures only authorized adults can remove children from the venue.
